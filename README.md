# Interlibrary Add-on

This Cloud App is adding features to help handling Borrowing Request activities more smoothly.

##1. "External localization"

####In connection with fulfilling borrowning requests from users, librarians may need to search for materials from partners or library cooperatives.
The "External localization" part of Interlibrary Add-on provides functionality to create personal templates in order to automate these searches.   

#### How to use "External localization"
Using "External localization" is done in **two steps**:
1. Create one or more URL-templates in App-settings - different Alma-attributes(ISBN, Title, Author) can be specified as a part of the URL. 
2. Go to the "External localization" part of the app. When borrowing requests are shown in Alma, a list with borrowing request based links will now show. The links will have names specified by the user.

Futher information can be found by pressing the info-icon in "Add template" dialog in the settings part. Remember that **"full screen mode" is available** - the feature can be helpfull in the process of adding new templates.  

##2. "Convert Borrowing Requests to Digitization Request"
